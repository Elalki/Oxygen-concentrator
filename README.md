# Oxygen-concentrator

This is the RepRap Ltd repository for all the information, designs, and data for our open-source Oxygen Concentrator.

The primary aim of this project is to get a working design out.  We hope that others will then use that as the basis for improvements and variations.  See the *How Can You Help* section below.  This repository now incorporates some ideas from comments to our original blog post about it.  A big Thank You to all who have made suggestions; please make more!

## Introduction

![Oxygen concentrator block diagram](Pix/o2-concentrator.png)

With the World’s current problems caused by covid-19, it seemes to us that an open-source oxygen concentrator would be a useful thing to have.  These are fairly simple devices that work by pressure swing adsorbtion.  The block diagram for what we propose is shown above.

To understand what’s going on, start at the end with the flow to the patient (top right).  There’s a small manual thumb valve (D) and flow meter that controls the flow of O<sub>2</sub> concentrate (that is, up to 90% O~2~ with the rest N2 and so on from the air).  90% is the figure quoted for the commercial machines, and it’s rather confusing.  We don’t think it means a gas that’s 90% O2 (which we’re pretty sure would be toxic); we think it means 1.9 times as much oxygen as usual; in other words a gas that’s about 40% O2 and 60% N2 etc.  If you’re an anesthetist and actually know, drop a comment below, ideally with a reference.

The O2 is stored in a membrane pressure reservoir that has a sensor to tell the microcontroller (not shown) operating the entire machine when the level is getting low.  That microcontroller would only need to be an Arduino Uno, or similar.   The reservoir and sensor could literally be as simple an object as a plastic bag between two hinged flat sheets with a weight on top and a switch activated as the weight moves upwards (thanks@Joel_Driver; and see below).

When the pressure drops the microcontroller drives a MOSFET to open the solenoid valve A (all the valves shown are normally closed) and compressed air flows into the zeolite granules in the chamber on the left.  N2 has a large quadrupole moment (an aspect of the pattern of electric charges round the molecule) relative to O2. This means that it “fits” into the surface of zeolite much better and adsorbs onto it in preference, leaving the O2 free in the chamber under pressure.  After about 3 seconds valve A is closed and valve B is opened allowing that O2 into the pressure reservoir, then B is closed.

Then that process is repeated with the zeolite on the right, while valve C on the left is opened to allow the N2 in the left-hand chamber to desorb and vent to the air.

The best zeolites to use for this seem to be 5A or 13X, but we are still investigating that.

The compressed air would be required at the sorts of pressures and flow rates easily achievable by a 12 volt care tyre inflator.  All the plumbing would be done using push-fit pneumatic connectors and PU pipe.  The air would have to be dry, and have most of the CO2 scrubbed out of it.  Extra tanks with silical gel and activated carbon should be able to achieve that.  The carbon would be purged of adsorbed CO2 from time to time in the same way as the purge described above.  The silical gel and zeolite would have to be dried periodically.  The simplest way to do that would probably be to put them in a kitchen oven (electric, not gas…).  You would have one set working in the machine, and another set being dried, then swap them over.

@Joel_Driver has suggested that 0.5L sparkling drinks bottles might work well as the zeolite pressure vessels.  An alternative might be refillable in-line filter housing reverse osmosis units, which usefully come with 6mm push-fit couplings on the ends and built-in filters.

The mesh filters (cut from a kitchen sieve?) are to prevent the zeolite granules getting into the valves (or the patient…).  It would probably be a good idea if the device was actually arranged as shown with the flow up from the bottom to the top for the same reason.  As to size – the whole thing would be about shoe-box size plus the compressor.

Throughout this we have deliberately linked to non-medical-grade common very-low-cost components and materials of about the quality that one might expect in – say – a child’s swimming snorkel and mask.  To be most useful, this thing has to be manufacturable anywhere in the World at low cost.  And you trust your child’s life to that snorkel and mask…

We have started a Github repository for this device here.

## How can you help?

Here’s how we see this developing:

We’ll get our version working.
Other people make copies and variations.
We and others make measurements (O2 concentration, CO2 contamination etc).
Fix what’s needed to get those right.
Fix anything needed to get the machine useful
In developing countries, and in the developed world in remote and emergency situations.
In the developed world in hospital and clinic situations.
Note that we explicitly acknowledge that less rigorous standards are appropriate for emergencies than for well-controlled locations, and that that allows more benefit to be obtained than insisting on the highest standard everywhere.

The first design is neither final nor prototyped yet, but there is nothing to stop you taking what we have posted on Github and building it experimentally.  But the point where we would appreciate people getting involved is Stage 2. onwards.  In particular it’s important that others change the design to make improvements so that the best designs emerge from a large number of experiments (this is what happened with the RepRap Project and is the reason it was so successful).

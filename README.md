# Oxygen-concentrator

This is the RepRap Ltd repository for all the information, designs, and data for our open-source Oxygen Concentrator.

The primary aim of this project is to get a working design out.  We hope that others will then use that as the basis for improvements and variations.  See the *How Can You Help* section below.  This repository now incorporates some ideas from comments to our original blog post about it.  A big *Thank You* to all who have made suggestions; please make more using the issue link above!

## Introduction

![Oxygen concentrator block diagram](Pix/o2-concentrator.png)

With the World’s current problems caused by [covid-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019), it seemed to us that an open-source [oxygen concentrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_concentrator) would be a useful thing to have.  These are fairly simple devices that work by [pressure swing adsorbtion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_swing_adsorption#Rapid_PSA).  The block diagram for what we propose is shown above.

To understand what’s going on, start at the end with the flow to the patient (top right).  There’s a small manual thumb valve (D) and flow meter that controls the flow of O<sub>2</sub> concentrate (that is, up to 90% O<sub>2</sub> with the rest N<sub>2</sub> and so on from the air).  90% is the figure quoted for the commercial machines, and it’s rather confusing.  We don’t think it means a gas that’s 90% O<sub>2</sub> (which we’re pretty sure would be toxic); we think it means 1.9 times as much oxygen as usual; in other words a gas that’s about 40% O<sub>2</sub> and 60% N<sub>2</sub> etc.  If you’re an anesthetist and actually know, drop an issue (link above), ideally with a reference.

Before that the O<sub>2</sub> is passed through a rehydrator.  This bubbles the stream through water, which has UV LEDs illuminating it to keep it sterilised.  It comes from a constant pressure reservoir that has a sensor to tell the microcontroller (not shown) operating the entire machine when the level is getting low.  The current design uses an [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3) as the controller.  The reservoir and sensor could be as simple as an [Ambu bag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_valve_mask) between two hinged flat sheets with a weight on top and a switch that opens as the weight moves upwards.

When the weight drops the microcontroller drives a MOSFET to open the solenoid valve A (all the valves shown are normally closed) and compressed air flows into the zeolite granules in the chamber on the left.  N<sub>2 has a large quadrupole moment (an aspect of the pattern of electric charges round the molecule) relative to O<sub>2</sub>. This means that it “fits” into the surface of zeolite much better and adsorbs onto it in preference, leaving the O<sub>2</sub> free in the chamber under pressure.  After about 3 seconds valve A is closed and valve B is opened allowing that O<sub>2</sub> into the pressure reservoir, then B is closed.

Then that process is repeated with the zeolite on the right, while valve C on the left is opened to allow the N<sub>2</sub> in the left-hand chamber to desorb and vent to the air.

The best zeolite to use for this seems to be 13X, but we are still investigating that.

At the bottom of the diagram, the compressed air is conditioned first by a silica gel filter to remove water vapour and then an activated carbon filter to remove CO<sub>2</sub>.  Both these gasses would reduce the efficiency of the zeolite, and (because of the preferential adsorption of the N<sub>2</sub>) atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> would also become too concentrated in the output.  The carbon would be purged of adsorbed CO<sub>2</sub> from time to time in the same way as the purge described above.  The silical gel and maybe the zeolite would have to be dried periodically.  The simplest way to do that would probably be to put them in a kitchen oven (electric, not gas…).  You would have one set working in the machine, and another set being dried, then swap them over.  Silica gel can be obtained including an indicator which changes colour when it gets wet.

The compressed air would be required at the sorts of pressures and flow rates easily achievable by a 12 volt care tyre inflator.  All the plumbing is done using push-fit pneumatic connectors and PU pipe.  

The best devices to use to contain the zeolite, carbon, and silica gel seem to be refillable in-line filter housing reverse osmosis units, which usefully come with 6mm push-fit couplings on the ends and built-in foam filters to retain particles of active material that will prevent the zeolite granules getting into the valves (or the patient…).  It would probably be a good idea if the device was actually arranged as shown with the flow up from the bottom to the top for the same reason.  As to size – the whole thing would be about microwave-oven size plus the compressor.

Throughout this we have deliberately linked to non-medical-grade common very-low-cost components and materials of about the quality that one might expect in – say – a child’s swimming snorkel and mask.  To be most useful, this thing has to be manufacturable anywhere in the World at low cost.  And you trust your child’s life to that snorkel and mask…


## How can you help?

Here’s how we see this developing:

1. We’ll get our version working.
2. Other people make copies and variations.
3. We and others make measurements (O2 concentration, CO2 contamination etc).
4. Fix what’s needed to get those right.
5. Fix anything needed to get the machine useful
..1. In developing countries, and in the developed world in remote and emergency situations.
..2. In the developed world in hospital and clinic situations.

Note that we explicitly acknowledge that less rigorous standards are appropriate for emergencies than for well-controlled locations, and that that allows more benefit to be obtained than insisting on the highest standard everywhere.

The first design is neither final nor prototyped yet, but there is nothing to stop you taking what we have posted here and building it experimentally.  But the point where we would appreciate people getting involved is Stage 2. onwards.  In particular it’s important that others change the design to make improvements so that the best designs emerge from a large number of experiments (this is what happened with the [RepRap Project](https://reprap.org) and is the reason it was so successful).
